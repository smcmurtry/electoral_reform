      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p class='FPTP'>
        A first-past-the-post voting system is one in which voters are required to indicate on the ballot the candidate of their choice, and the candidate who receives more votes than any other candidate wins. The first-past-the-post voting method is one of the several plurality voting systems. It is a common, but not universal, feature of voting systems with single member electoral divisions. The system is widely used in the United Kingdom and United States, most of their current and former colonies and protectorates, and a few other countries. From <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting'>Wikipedia</a>.

      <p class='DMP'>
        Dual-member proportional representation (DMP) is a voting system designed to produce proportional election results across a region by electing two representatives in each of the region’s districts. The 1st seat in every district is awarded to the candidate who receives the most votes, similar to first-past-the-post voting (FPTP). The 2nd seat is awarded to one of the remaining district candidates so that proportionality is achieved across the region, using a calculation that aims to award parties their seats in the districts where they had their strongest performances. From <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-member_proportional_representation'>Wikipedia</a>.

      <p class='MMP'>
        Mixed-member proportional representation is a hybrid two-tier voting system. MMP was originally used to elect representatives to the German Bundestag, which has also been adopted by New Zealand, Lesotho, Bolivia and Romania (only in 2008 and 2012 elections). MMP is a hybrid method that uses party list proportional representation (PR) as its proportional component, and currently (but not necessarily) first-past-the-post voting (FPTP) as its district component. It is considered a mixed system (also known as a hybrid system or a semi-proportional representation system), which is a distinct voting system. "An electoral system is "mixed" if more than one formula is employed to distribute legislative seats." From <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation'>Wikipedia</a>.
      </p>
      <p class='IRV'>
        Instant-runoff voting (IRV), also known as the alternative vote (AV), transferable vote, (single-seat) ranked choice voting (RCV), or preferential voting, is a voting system used to elect a single candidate from a field of more than two candidates. It is a preferential voting system in which voters rank candidates in order of preference, rather than voting for a single candidate. Ballots are initially counted for each elector's first choice candidate. If a candidate secures more than half of the votes, that candidate wins. Otherwise, the candidate in last place loses, and votes for that candidate are added to the totals of the candidate ranked next on each ballot. This process repeats until one candidate wins by obtaining more than half the votes. In the final "instant runoff," the winner always has majority support of those voters who indicated a preference for one or more of the finalists.
