      <h2>How does <span id='system-title' class='changeable'>First Past the Post</span> work?</h2>

      <div class='FPTP'>
        <div>
          First Past the Post (FPTP) is Canada’s current electoral system. Voters in each riding vote for one candidate in that riding. Whoever has the most votes is elected as the MP for that riding.

          </span>
        </div>

        <div class='IRV'>
          <div>
            Under alternative vote (AV), each riding elects one Member of Parliament (MP). Voters rank candidates in order of preference. The winning candidate must have the support of a majority of voters in the riding, if necessary via a transfer of votes from eliminated candidates.

          </span>
        </div>

      <div class='DMP'>
        <div>
          Dual-member proportional representation (DMP) is a voting system designed to produce proportional election results across a region by electing two representatives in each of the region’s districts. The 1st seat in every district is awarded to the candidate who receives the most votes, similar to first-past-the-post voting (FPTP). The 2nd seat is awarded to one of the remaining district candidates so that proportionality is achieved across the region, using a calculation that aims to award parties their seats in the districts where they had their strongest performances.

          </span>
        </div>

      <div class='MMP'>
        <div>
          Mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) is mixed or “hybrid” because it combines elements of proportional and single-member plurality systems. With MMP, voters have a single MP who represents their riding, while other seats are distributed proportionately to total votes cast in the election.

          Voters have two votes: one for a candidate running in their riding, and a second for a party or a candidate on a party list.

          </span>
        </div>

        <div class='STV'>
          <div>
            The single transferable vote (STV) combines elements of different systems to both achieve a relatively proportional result and to elect MPs from specific constituencies. It has ranked ballots and large ridings, each with multiple elected MPs.

        The results below are from a simulation done using Elections Canada voting results. The MMP system presented here is one possible design that uses regions with an average of 10 MPs - other designs could have bigger or smaller regions. The results do not take into account changes in voting behaviour that would result from a change to the electoral system.</p>
      <p class='IRV'>The results below are from a simulation done using Elections Canada voting results and exit polling to ask about second choices. They do not take into account changes in voting behaviour that would result from a change to the electoral system.</p>
